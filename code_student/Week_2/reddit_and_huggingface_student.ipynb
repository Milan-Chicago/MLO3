If we get to $700s, dip and incredible buying opportunity. Sustained growth requires some pullback, support, resistance, and testing both. Elon selling stock is a distraction. He owns ~20% of Tesla. Selling 10% of that is 2%, which gets swallowed up by regular trading volume. Keep buying, be patient, we‚Äôll eventually get back over $1200 with proper support. Might take a few years.\n",

One of these ideas or memes may prove profitable, but highly unlikely for the retail investor to win with any one memes of his.

It brings controversy aka advertisements for tesla. Of we have boring ass ceo, tesla wouldn‚Äôt be as big as today. No one believe him when he started talking about ev back in the day. Let him talk about dogecoin. Dogecoin is like third largest crypto currency. You know what that means? A lot of people own dogecoin who are now pro Elon who are now thinking about buying tesla cars and invest in tesla. For me his tweets worth more than whatever Ford, GM and the others automakers ads budget. Also, I‚Äôm not worried about the stock is down right now because i cover call my tsla weekly. It‚Äôs a freaking great weekly income. Tsla options premium are great. I use half of premium to buy more tsla and the other half to buy other equity, mostly reit. And use the dividend from there as my monthly salary. Life is good. I‚Äôm not selling my 9000 shares till tsla hit 3000, maybe. Lol. I sold 1000 shares when it was in 800 due to losing my day job because of stupid covid. But if you wanna sell yours feel free. It‚Äôs your stocks. But i‚Äôm not selling mine just because tsla down this year.\n",
      "I think Tesla is a great company with a lot of revenue streams and tons of upside potential. That being said, I‚Äôll be unloading the bulk of my position as soon as I reach my cost basis. I kept buying the dip to reduce my cost basis, and I ran out of capital I was willing to use to keep purchasing so I‚Äôm basically buried right now. My cost average is $749. I think it‚Äôll be a while before the stock gets back to that level which sucks because I don‚Äôt want to take a loss and I don‚Äôt want this much Tesla stock as a percentage of my portfolio.\n",

      "Was thinking about buying tsla when it dippp\n",
      "IMO this stock is not up and down due to Elon as much as it is due to the market manipulation.  Naked shorts, buying shares off market and shenanigans that are not available to retail traders.  This is what is hurting the entire stock market right now - but particularly a few heavily shorted stocks.  Moreover, look at other EV companies that started within 10 years of Tesla.  Elon has proven that no-one could have done this but him.  I think if you can hold your shares - they will be worth way more in 5 years.\n",
      "If you have such a problem with Elon, they why even invest? Elon is Tesla, Tesla is Elon. They are one. If you can't handle that just sell your shares right now, buy NIO, and leave us the hell alone. I'm sorry that you have to save for your kids college fund but do us a favor and leave....\n",

      "I'm no stock market expert, but I feel like I have a basic sense of the mechanics that move the stock. Firstly, the stock sells at a high P/E ratio. That alone might give enough reason for people who are not informed, to sell the stock in a bear market. Secondly, there is a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) put out by mainstream outlets, many of which have a conflict of interest and hold stock in things like lidar, legacy auto companies, oil and gas, etc. Some have the fear that \"the competition is coming\", others have little faith in FSD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, all of these reasons that I listed stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of the company. Judging a high growth company, like Tesla, by it's P/E ratio makes little sense as each quarter Tesla has manages to surpass expectations.  Just recently they raised their prices on all of their cars, and with no shortage of demand, this will likely only increase their margins. Furthermore, they will be opening up two gigafactories (Berlin and Texas), which will increase output. It will take some time for them to ramp up those factories, but, I expect these will only be positive catalyst for the stock in the near future. It is important to note the media bias. Tesla doesn't invest in PR, which has divided opinion among Tesla investors. Nor do they invest in advertising. Instead the philosophy appears to be something like \"let the product and data speak for itself\". Personally, I appreciate this. Personally, I am also more bullish on FSD the way Tesla is solving it versus other car companies. Personally, I believe that other car manufacturers are going to find it difficult to remain profitable,, switching their operations to EV, versus Tesla who is able to create superior products at lower prices.

Of course Microstrategy was speaking with Elon in the background of all this and knew about Tesla's purchase of #bitcoin.  Sad that us little guys don't get to benefit from this kind of inside info.  I'm feeling kinda sad that Papa Elon recently started commenting to help line the pockets of his friends.

I'm sure after or close to these factories being built they will build more factories. They are improving the process every time they build a factory and trying to make the footprints and costs smaller with the same production.\n",

If they were able to spend all 20 billion and have 10 factories they would probably be producing more cars then what the demand is.

Because of this their self driving is not easily scalable compared to when Tesla achieve fsd, it will be able to drive anywhere. They will also achieve this quicker due to having the most cars on the road by far, therefore generating the most data for the self driving.

Will this continue into next year or post Christmas will we see supply chains start to unblock, demand levels normalize, and a reduction in money printing (tapering expected in Nov) which will all impact inflation. Q1 2022 will provide critical evidence. Cathie Woods from ARK is the most prominent ‚Äòtransitory inflation‚Äô besides the Fed. In fact she believes deflation is a risk is a year or two as technology improves transparency, logistics and customer value (i.e. TVs from 3 years ago are cheaper today with same tech). \n",

These current inflation numbers IMO are driven primarily from supply chain blocks (Just look at LA port with 12 weeks backlog when normally it‚Äôs measured in days or less) and huge consumer demand (chip manufacturers especially caught out as everyone bought new computers/phones/TVs for home whilst their production was impacted due to Covid and nowadays impacted in the lead up to Christmas demand as mentioned above). Feds also have been clear about their expectations and everything seems on track IMO. We should see tapering start in November which will cause short term shock and interest rates start to increase 2Q next year, which again will cause a short term shock but honestly everyone should be aware of this even today so any shocks will disappear. Obviously the faster the stock price runs in the meantime, the more impact this will have. But that‚Äôs the way I‚Äôm placing my bets ‚Äì have some trading calls accordingly but not worried about any of this for my core investment shares as none of this impacts the core thesis.\n"

Recently Tesla financials revealed that their profitability without revenue from carbon credits from other auto manufacturers, they would have been losing money.  Also, their profitability per car sold is down to something like 18% from 23% according to some analyst.  As more competitors enter the market, they'll have to decide if they would prefer to lower the cost of their vehicle to prevent paying Tesla the carbon credit, which many will do rather than leave market share on the table.  Thus lowering the price only allows Tesla to maintain current market share, but doesn't insure future sales.  The other guys are going to enter the market regardless of Tesla's reduction.

      "Thank you for sharing. I think some parts of your analysis are missing the point that Tesla is a hybrid company partially car manufacturer and partially self driving technology. I think your valuation could be off because you are not considering the portion of the 1 trillion that will go to self driving business where billions could be needed.   You have correctly compared Tesla with auto manufacturers but not factored it‚Äôs self driving business driving where comparable P/E ratios do not exist. Competitors can indeed start gathering data but there are time and cost implications giving still the advantage to Tesla. I think you are also missing revenue potential from India. Tesla was a first mover in electric vehicles (with some people doubting) and now is one of the first movers in the self driving business (again seen far away but shorters). Another relevant point, I think, is the use of Bitcoin to hedge inflation. Ironically, Tesla should be less impacted. Finally, fundamentally, I believe the stock is or could be oversold due to the bond bullies (move that seems unfounded given all the time that  the US economy still needs to get to full steam). I agree that Tesla will go through a correction during the next week(s) possibility going as low as 450 or less. This will create the momentum for retail cult investors needed for the stock to bounce back all this without considering that Tesla can buy buy creating more uplift momentum. Can you send me the link to your previous video? I like looking at work that is through like yours.\n",
      "Well I think if you want to short momentarily it‚Äôs a different story. If you truly think tesla is gonna stay down then as we all do, just speculating here but my bet is you‚Äôre gonna lose money.\n",
      "Tesla is a highly diversified company, it barely is considered just a car manufacturer anymore. Be it TA or fundamentals I think moment it hits 480 it will have to bounce back. Market had reached a plateau, this year we do expect a flash crash in general. But I wouldn‚Äôt put my bets on tesla going down for too long. Just my two cents. But to each their own.\n",
      "Buy and hold. It will up. Never short tsla!!!\n",
      "Great research ! Great explanation. I am looking for a great entry point into TSLA too but it's been falling by 100 almost every week since last earnings call. I also don't want to wait too long thinking it will go to 400 and miss out on a more \"reasonable entry point\" like 580, 540 may be ?  or may be 500 ?\n",
      "Very insightful analysis, thank you for sharing. I have a short term bearish view on it as well, but it could certainly be a long term winner. For now we ride the trend down until the trend changes.\n",

Also, win it comes to supporting the grid, using tesla battery technology is too expensive to do so when there are companies like Ambri (Donald Sadoway) that are developing inexpensive liquid metal technologies for stationary electric grid support.  Also Tesla's battery technology will see significant battery technology competition from companies that are developing solid state like Quantumscape among many others.  If Tesla sinks too much money into lithium batteries, they won't have money to switch over to producing solid state without losing some level of investment.

Well maybe not Tesla, but hey they have a a nice long head start with the big Automakers still scratching theirs heads on how to approach this. VW is the worst example - selling their cars to their dealers and concluding these as sales is an all new low. The same VW that created Diesel gate. Bring it on.\n",

For instance- when full self driving robotaxis become good enough and approved through regulation that is a MASSIVE financial opportunity, in the range of 100s of billions/year: I challenge you to find another tech company anywhere that is anywhere near Tesla. The belief that we will eventually solve that problem is a huge part of Tesla‚Äôs value. Tesla has a million + care on the road training its neural net. Waymo? In the thousands. \n",
