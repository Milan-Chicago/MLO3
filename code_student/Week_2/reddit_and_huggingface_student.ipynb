No technical support for it. Where we are now is not a dip. It’s the unwinding of shares purchased to hedge that’s pushing it down. When we get back to $800s, expected. If we get to $700s, dip and incredible buying opportunity. Sustained growth requires some pullback, support, resistance, and testing both. Elon selling stock is a distraction. He owns ~20% of Tesla. Selling 10% of that is 2%, which gets swallowed up by regular trading volume. Keep buying, be patient, we’ll eventually get back over $1200 with proper support. Might take a few years.\n",

Promises, but not even that, just ideas of uncertain utility and unclear profitability.  He even jumped into crypto with Dogecoin.   One of these ideas or memes may prove profitable, but highly unlikely for the retail investor to win with any one memes of his.

I have been telling you to just look at a basic value indicator called P/E ratio.  There’s no way that 1,200 years after having its best quarter in December 2020 was going to hold.  Keep listening to your folks that tell you hold, ironically of course.  The good news is that TSLA is no close to bankruptcy like it was on 1Q2020, that the company has a bright future if Elon becomes a more moderate Manager, he is a genius but he needs to get a good manager to run the company and stop adding volatility to his business.\n",

Have there been any actual contracts signed or orders placed?  Is there even clarity from states, fed, cities, DOT, etc allowing these vehicles to operate in large volumes?

However, I don’t think his tweets is the reason why the stock is down. I mean every growth stock had a major run in 2020. A pause and correction shouldn’t come as a shock.

      "When did you first invest with tsla? Before the 2019-2020 run up, tsla was horrible lol right now is nothing. And Elon been tweeting random stuff. I like it. It brings controversy aka advertisements for tesla. Of we have boring ass ceo, tesla wouldn’t be as big as today. No one believe him when he started talking about ev back in the day. Let him talk about dogecoin. Dogecoin is like third largest crypto currency. You know what that means? A lot of people own dogecoin who are now pro Elon who are now thinking about buying tesla cars and invest in tesla. For me his tweets worth more than whatever Ford, GM and the others automakers ads budget. Also, I’m not worried about the stock is down right now because i cover call my tsla weekly. It’s a freaking great weekly income. Tsla options premium are great. I use half of premium to buy more tsla and the other half to buy other equity, mostly reit. And use the dividend from there as my monthly salary. Life is good. I’m not selling my 9000 shares till tsla hit 3000, maybe. Lol. I sold 1000 shares when it was in 800 due to losing my day job because of stupid covid. But if you wanna sell yours feel free. It’s your stocks. But i’m not selling mine just because tsla down this year.\n",
      "I think Tesla is a great company with a lot of revenue streams and tons of upside potential. That being said, I’ll be unloading the bulk of my position as soon as I reach my cost basis. I kept buying the dip to reduce my cost basis, and I ran out of capital I was willing to use to keep purchasing so I’m basically buried right now. My cost average is $749. I think it’ll be a while before the stock gets back to that level which sucks because I don’t want to take a loss and I don’t want this much Tesla stock as a percentage of my portfolio.\n",

      "Was thinking about buying tsla when it dippp\n",
      "IMO this stock is not up and down due to Elon as much as it is due to the market manipulation.  Naked shorts, buying shares off market and shenanigans that are not available to retail traders.  This is what is hurting the entire stock market right now - but particularly a few heavily shorted stocks.  Moreover, look at other EV companies that started within 10 years of Tesla.  Elon has proven that no-one could have done this but him.  I think if you can hold your shares - they will be worth way more in 5 years.\n",
      "If you have such a problem with Elon, they why even invest? Elon is Tesla, Tesla is Elon. They are one. If you can't handle that just sell your shares right now, buy NIO, and leave us the hell alone. I'm sorry that you have to save for your kids college fund but do us a favor and leave....\n",

People are taking profits and re-balancing portfolios because the FED literally came on TV and said we won't be propping up the market any longer. Add to that, Elon stated they won't be making any new models this year (no hype) and supply chain issues will undoubtedly cause trouble for their production numbers. 1200$ was the top for the foreseeable future for sure.

At the peak of the dotcom bubble, Microsoft had a P/E ratio of around 65. When sanity returned to the market, post-bubble, Microsoft's P/E fell as low as 15.

How does this hyper mileage car perform for acceleration after the pack has 200,000 Miles on it and how long does this pack take to charge from nearly depleted to fully charged? This is worth investigating, and may be a glimpse into some of the additional performance gains of the 4680 Structural battery pack about to roll out along with single piece front and rear Structural framework which all together. leads to a lighter, more rigid, repeatable structure shape, allowing consistent placement of Body parts with tight panel gaps, a suspension that has solid anchoring and alignment for better all around handling!  I suspect the range of such a practical car using this battery technology will be less,  to allow the production of a car  that is affordable and has the longevity expected of a Practical EV.   \n",

So if you want your fair value of Tesla compared to GM or Ford..  at the best case and growth scenario right now you can run forward with the stock at a value of maybe 150-200.

      "I'm no stock market expert, but I feel like I have a basic sense of the mechanics that move the stock. Firstly, the stock sells at a high P/E ratio. That alone might give enough reason for people who are not informed, to sell the stock in a bear market. Secondly, there is a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) put out by mainstream outlets, many of which have a conflict of interest and hold stock in things like lidar, legacy auto companies, oil and gas, etc. Some have the fear that \"the competition is coming\", others have little faith in FSD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, all of these reasons that I listed stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of the company. Judging a high growth company, like Tesla, by it's P/E ratio makes little sense as each quarter Tesla has manages to surpass expectations.  Just recently they raised their prices on all of their cars, and with no shortage of demand, this will likely only increase their margins. Furthermore, they will be opening up two gigafactories (Berlin and Texas), which will increase output. It will take some time for them to ramp up those factories, but, I expect these will only be positive catalyst for the stock in the near future. It is important to note the media bias. Tesla doesn't invest in PR, which has divided opinion among Tesla investors. Nor do they invest in advertising. Instead the philosophy appears to be something like \"let the product and data speak for itself\". Personally, I appreciate this. Personally, I am also more bullish on FSD the way Tesla is solving it versus other car companies. Personally, I believe that other car manufacturers are going to find it difficult to remain profitable,, switching their operations to EV, versus Tesla who is able to create superior products at lower prices.

Easy to plug in when home at end of day if you’re running low and schedule it to be done in the morning and take advantage of off peak power overnight for even cheaper charging. Lots of time saved each week from no longer needing to stop at gas station, pump, queue, pay and drive out.\n",

      "For those still driving gas powered cars (most of us!), have you considered when the sweet spot will be to \"sell off\" and move on to an EV vehicle? I ask because I have a v8, 4-wheel-drive Sequoia that gets 13 miles to the gallon. It wasn't cheap to buy and I want to sell it for a decent price when the time comes. I have a bad feeling about holding it too long. Once EV are more abundant, the prices to buy them will make big gas guzzlers less appealing. \n",

      "This is really whacked.  So\n",
      "We are making everyone have electric cars that we will charge with windmills and solar panels made in China.  We have no where near what we need to accomplish this.  Where is all\n",
      "Of the lithium coming from for the batteries.  We are running low as it is and haven’t even ramped up.  Why do t we make solar\n",
      "Panels in the j tier states?   It’s all\n",
      "Add backward\n",
      "I did the math where I live and it costs about $2 - $3. I also signed up for a peak time plan with my power company. Overnight charging is fueled by Nuclear. The problem isn't electric cars it's coal. We need more nukes. But long story short charging your care is WAAAAY cheaper than gas. Also, electric cars need way less maintenance. Total cost of ownership will prove that electric is greater. It would help to get the prices down for EVs across the board, though to compete and different price levels.\n"

Elon Musk is not perfect and has his idiosyncrasies just like you and me. However, if there is one visionary worth following and supporting who is actively transforming our present day and future reality into something that is perceivably and tangibly better than it has ever been before, it is Elon.\n",

      "- free advertising when SpaceX was sending its first rockets up Tesla stock would increase, but when he shot a Tesla car into space, the free advertising from all the news articles about it. \n",

People don’t understand with Tesla’s competitors which have some self driving capabilities, that not only are they using additional LiDAR sensors which are costly, the way in which they drive is like a train on tracks, has to be mapped in great detail and can’t properly adapt to adverse situations. Because of this their self driving is not easily scalable compared to when Tesla achieve fsd, it will be able to drive anywhere. They will also achieve this quicker due to having the most cars on the road by far, therefore generating the most data for the self driving. They also have plans to implement not only in car gaming at very high level quality but also a business meetings app which will increase peoples want to purchase the self driving software. \n",

      "12) They are creating a vehicle for every category, including a 25k price point which will access a much larger potential customer base. \n",

Will this continue into next year or post Christmas will we see supply chains start to unblock, demand levels normalize, and a reduction in money printing (tapering expected in Nov) which will all impact inflation. Q1 2022 will provide critical evidence. Cathie Woods from ARK is the most prominent ‘transitory inflation’ besides the Fed. In fact she believes deflation is a risk is a year or two as technology improves transparency, logistics and customer value (i.e. TVs from 3 years ago are cheaper today with same tech). \n",

      "How will this effect growth stocks? Rising inflation makes supplier parts more expensive and product more expensive making it harder for consumers to buy – so less demand, revenue and profits.

These current inflation numbers IMO are driven primarily from supply chain blocks (Just look at LA port with 12 weeks backlog when normally it’s measured in days or less) and huge consumer demand (chip manufacturers especially caught out as everyone bought new computers/phones/TVs for home whilst their production was impacted due to Covid and nowadays impacted in the lead up to Christmas demand as mentioned above). Feds also have been clear about their expectations and everything seems on track IMO. We should see tapering start in November which will cause short term shock and interest rates start to increase 2Q next year, which again will cause a short term shock but honestly everyone should be aware of this even today so any shocks will disappear. Obviously the faster the stock price runs in the meantime, the more impact this will have. But that’s the way I’m placing my bets – have some trading calls accordingly but not worried about any of this for my core investment shares as none of this impacts the core thesis.\n"

Recently Tesla financials revealed that their profitability without revenue from carbon credits from other auto manufacturers, they would have been losing money.  Also, their profitability per car sold is down to something like 18% from 23% according to some analyst.  As more competitors enter the market, they'll have to decide if they would prefer to lower the cost of their vehicle to prevent paying Tesla the carbon credit, which many will do rather than leave market share on the table.  Thus lowering the price only allows Tesla to maintain current market share, but doesn't insure future sales.  The other guys are going to enter the market regardless of Tesla's reduction.  Doing otherwise would mean a sharp decrease in their share price.  Tesla's stock price didn't go up, but many EV competitor stock prices have been going down relative to Tesla.\n",

It seems to me that Musk’s BTC and Crypto dialogue is a distraction from the increasing competition.  Competition is forcing TSLA to drop the prices of its more popular cars  hurting the company’s ridiculous P/E ratio (over 1,200 years) and cash flow.  BTC is saving TSLA for now, if BTC turns around, TSLA stock will go to $50.  Very risky move, but Elon is about that, he is a 🧞‍♂️but also a master of disguise and a lover of volatility.  Fasten your seat belts and enjoy the ride.  Hope it last enough for all to profit.\n",

      "Thank you for sharing. I think some parts of your analysis are missing the point that Tesla is a hybrid company partially car manufacturer and partially self driving technology. I think your valuation could be off because you are not considering the portion of the 1 trillion that will go to self driving business where billions could be needed.   You have correctly compared Tesla with auto manufacturers but not factored it’s self driving business driving where comparable P/E ratios do not exist. Competitors can indeed start gathering data but there are time and cost implications giving still the advantage to Tesla. I think you are also missing revenue potential from India. Tesla was a first mover in electric vehicles (with some people doubting) and now is one of the first movers in the self driving business (again seen far away but shorters). Another relevant point, I think, is the use of Bitcoin to hedge inflation. Ironically, Tesla should be less impacted. Finally, fundamentally, I believe the stock is or could be oversold due to the bond bullies (move that seems unfounded given all the time that  the US economy still needs to get to full steam). I agree that Tesla will go through a correction during the next week(s) possibility going as low as 450 or less. This will create the momentum for retail cult investors needed for the stock to bounce back all this without considering that Tesla can buy buy creating more uplift momentum. Can you send me the link to your previous video? I like looking at work that is through like yours.\n",
      "Well I think if you want to short momentarily it’s a different story. If you truly think tesla is gonna stay down then as we all do, just speculating here but my bet is you’re gonna lose money.\n",
      "Tesla is a highly diversified company, it barely is considered just a car manufacturer anymore. Be it TA or fundamentals I think moment it hits 480 it will have to bounce back. Market had reached a plateau, this year we do expect a flash crash in general. But I wouldn’t put my bets on tesla going down for too long. Just my two cents. But to each their own.\n",
      "Buy and hold. It will up. Never short tsla!!!\n",
      "Great research ! Great explanation. I am looking for a great entry point into TSLA too but it's been falling by 100 almost every week since last earnings call. I also don't want to wait too long thinking it will go to 400 and miss out on a more \"reasonable entry point\" like 580, 540 may be ?  or may be 500 ?\n",
      "Very insightful analysis, thank you for sharing. I have a short term bearish view on it as well, but it could certainly be a long term winner. For now we ride the trend down until the trend changes.\n",

It's time to move on to the next growth stock.  Cathie Woods is trying to do a good job of chatting up Tesla because they own so much of it, but robo-taxis are waaay in the future, not within this year.  Also, win it comes to supporting the grid, using tesla battery technology is too expensive to do so when there are companies like Ambri (Donald Sadoway) that are developing inexpensive liquid metal technologies for stationary electric grid support.  Also Tesla's battery technology will see significant battery technology competition from companies that are developing solid state like Quantumscape among many others.  If Tesla sinks too much money into lithium batteries, they won't have money to switch over to producing solid state without losing some level of investment.  Tesla will be a nice stable growth stock without dividend payments.  The biggest Tesla mover to the upside will come from their speculative investments in bitcoin or SpaceX or Starlink when those companies give Tesla first dibs on the initial public offering.\n",
